## Moves

### A Tainted Past

You hail from a powerful, infamous lineage --- one with an impressive and terrible reputation. Your lineage has had a massive impact on the world within the scope of your story --- its reach extends over the whole scope, and everyone in the scope knows of it. Choose one domain that is the source of your lineage’s power -- the area in which they affected the world -- and another into which they’re now beginning to extend their reach.

- spiritual authority
- state politics

#### Lineage Resources
You have access to your family’s extensive stores of two of the following resources:

- obscure or forbidden knowledge
- spiritual artifacts or tomes

Spend resources during the session to establish a boon you had previously asked for or obtained, something that your lineage’s unique position and stores could provide: a vehicle, an invitation, a chest of jade coins, etc.

#### Humble Yourself

When you politely and obediently humble yourself before a powerful member of your lineage, roll with your Tradition. On a hit, you earn some credit; hold 3-resources. On a 7–9, their resources don’t come without strings; you’ll need to promise to fulfill some other obligation of your lineage, or let them shift your balance. On a miss, they’re dissatisfied with your display; they’re cutting you off until you fulfill some task they set to you.

#### Raid Your Lineage’s Resources
When you raid your lineage’s resources without their consent or knowledge, mark a condition and roll with your Progress. On a hit, hold 1-resource. On a 7–9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.

- You obtain an additional 1-resource
- You nab your goodies quietly; your lineage is none the wiser
- You steel yourself for what you’re doing; avoid marking a condition

On a miss, you’re caught red-handed by a powerful member of your lineage who saw you coming

### Black Koala-Sheep

When you behave in a way that shocks and unsettles people from one of your backgrounds, roll with Creativity to intimidate them or push your luck.

### Worldly Knowledge

Your upbringing expanded your horizons, skillsets, and contacts. Choose another training and another background.

## Character creation notes

- 13 years old
- family has tradition of spirit-bending (p216 in book), they're an important religious order, Order of the Blue Lotus, at the Northern Water Tribe capital (Agna Qel'a)
    - religious focus, blocked by tradition
    - above worldly concerns, trying to keep the Northern Water Tribe out of the war
- growing up, Atka had peers, but led a rarefied life, chafed (slightly) against boundaries, is curious
- still in touch with family, traveling with support of his family, which has an established tradition of exploring
- fighting style: "precise stick and balls", has ice prayer beads and staff, staff is like a bident, with a tuning fork at the top, tuned to differnet notes for differnt people, represents the harmony of the two worlds. style focuses on precision and economy of movement
- family does tattoos, swirly patterns and story-telling of own exploits (with spirits). Atka has just started getting his tattoos, at feet
- Ukyuk, leader of the order, is adamant that the Northern Water Tribte stay out of war, doesn't like others challenging his authority or asking questions, cares about control
- Sister Waaseyaa: prodigy, perky, rebellious, early 20s. close with Atka, "fun teacher", helps him explore what balance means
- Atka senses things are imbalanced, is uneasy and curious. is traveling, scouting (for imbalance?) by himself, as right of passage.
    - spiritual connection is very important (tends to ignore material aspects / people's ability to survive)
    - order focused on spirit world (over balance or human)
- parents also member of the Order, but Atka largely raised by non-parents in Order
- outside of the Northern Water Tribe, people know the Order is a spirital power with temporal influence, but unclear how exactly
    - the Fire Nation was spying on the Order, in favor of their continuing hold on power
    - rumor in Omashu: Order has powerful fortress and crazy powers
