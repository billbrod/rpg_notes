## Moves

### Squad Leader

You were the leader of a small group of 10 or so well-trained warriors from a recognized and noble tradition.

Where does your squad call home? Omashu

Which are the most well known traits of your squad? (choose up to 3):
- armbands, purpose

What does your squad value? (choose 2): 
- Justice, Innovation

Despite being the leader, you chose to travel with your new companions for the time being, until you’ve achieved this group’s purpose. Choose where your team is without you:
- fractured, doing the same thing but less effectively

Within any group, you serve a role both subtle and overt, sometimes leading the team, sometimes helping it glue itself together. You earn Team through your leadership style, and you spend Team through your support style. At the end of each session, you may change 1 style of leadership and 1 style of support.

Choose 2 styles of leadership. **Earn 1-Team** when...
- Firm: ...you openly call on a companion to live up to their principle.
- Empathetic: ...you guide and comfort a companion and they open up to you.

Choose 2 styles of support. **Spend 1-Team** when...
- Comforting: ...you spend time one- on-one in a quiet moment with a companion to clear a condition from them.
- Defending: ...you are within reach of a companion in combat to clear a negative status from them.

### A Warrior's Heart

When you **live up to your principle** while you have 3+ conditions marked, ignore your condition penalties. When you **live up to your principle** while you have 5 conditions marked, don’t mark fatigue

### Taking Care of Business

When you **lose your balance** in a battle, instead of choosing one of the normal options, you may instead sacrifice yourself for your companions. If you do, your companions have a chance to get away without issue, and you are taken out (and possibly captured). You also choose 1:

- Leave a clue your companions can follow
- Throw your companions one vulnerable object
- Provoke an opponent, shifting their balance twice

### Best Friend (Bold)

Your best friend is small, fuzzy, and dependable. Unlike all your other relationships, this one is simple and true. You can understand and communicate with your small companion and -- although they may give you a hard time now and again -- they are always there when you need them most. Whenever your pal could help you **push your luck**, mark fatigue to roll with Creativity instead of Passion. If your pet ever gets hurt, mark a condition.

## Techniques

<!--- to change these to "filled in", remove the `{ .unchecked }` bit at the end -->
| Name                  | Approach        | Level        | Text |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------|------|
| Slide Around the Blow | Evade & Observe |  :material-check-circle: :material-check-circle: :material-check-circle: |  You move perfectly, slipping past strikes and demanding an opponent’s attention; a foe you are engaged with must remain engaged with you and can only use techniques against you in the next exchange. If no foe is engaged with you, you may slip through the fight to engage a new foe (no foe may mark fatigue to stop you).    |
| Eat Dirt              | Evade & Observe |  :material-check-circle: :material-check-circle:{ .unchecked } :material-check-circle:{ .unchecked } | Even the smallest pebble can cause a gatorphant to stumble. Cause a foe to lose their footing. Your target is *Impaired* and unable to choose **defend and maneuver** in the next exchange.     |

## Character creation notes

- 16 years old
- earth bender, Katara-vibes: protective, controlling, trusting
- comes from a military family in Omashu
- fighting style is seismic sensing to know where people are and what they're doing, to pick strategic moves (sees things like a chessboard). naturally good at this, didn't fight much / receive formal training, seeking training. pays attention to details, others' feelings
- in Omashu, war is not actively discussed, part of a group of kids that feel like something isn't right
- Li Duanmu, his father's on the council of 5, knows about war, takes a wait and see approach, bit of a de facto leader of group (because bossy, knows things, is self-important), looks down on Bao
- Paku, best friend, bullied a lot
- Bao wants to take action, intercepts mail (against Li's orders) with Paku, who mysteriously disappeared (probably by Omashu officials??) because they learned too much about the war
- Bao doesn't feel like she can be the leader, but goes with personality. no formal hierarchy in group, tension between Bao and Li over it
- group had armband with anti-fire nation symbol, Bao has Paku's old one, which is tattered, she wears it as daily reminder to always consider every possibility -- but won't be passive
- after Paku got disappeared, Bao's mom Qiuyue got really overprotective, so they got in fight and Bao ran away (?) and have lost touch since then
- Bao full of self-doubt after Paku's disappearance, running from fear of leadership
- team has armbands, does lots of parkour and recon, cares deeply about Omashu. Paku illustrated zines
- Li Duanmu currently leading the group, but less effective because he's all talk and scared of risks.
