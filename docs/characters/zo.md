## Moves

### The Lodestar

There’s only one person you often let past your emotional walls.

Name your lodestar (choose a PC to start): Bao

You can shift your lodestar to someone new when they **guide and comfort** you and you open up to them, or when you **guide and comfort** them and they open up to you. If you do choose to shift your lodestar, clear a condition.

When you **shut down someone vulnerable to harsh words or icy silence**, shift your balance toward Results and roll with Results. On a hit, they mark a condition and you may clear the same condition. On a 10+, they also cannot shift your balance or **call you out** for the rest of the scene. On a miss, they have exactly the right retort; mark a condition and they shift your balance. You cannot use this on your lodestar.

When your lodestar **shifts your balance** or **calls you out**, you cannot resist it. Treat an NPC lodestar calling you out as if you rolled a 10+, and a PC lodestar calling you out as if they rolled a 10+.

When you **consult your lodestar for advice on a problem** (or permission to use your preferred solution), roll with Restraint. On a 10+ take all three; on a 7–9 they choose two:

- You see the wisdom of their advice. They shift your balance; follow their advice and they shift your balance again.
- The conversation bolsters you. Clear a condition or 2-fatigue.
- They feel at ease offering their opinion. They clear a condition or 2-fatigue.

On a miss, something about their advice infuriates you. Mark a condition or have the GM shift your balance twice.

### Takes One to Know One

When you verbally needle someone by finding the weaknesses in their armor, roll with Focus. On a hit, ask 1 question. On a 7-9, they ask 1 of you as well:

- What is your principle?
- What do you need to prove?
- What could shake your certainty?
- Whom do you care about more than you let on?

Anyone who lies or stonewalls marks 2-fatigue. On a miss, your attack leaves you exposed; they may ask you any one question from the list, and you must answer honestly.

### Driven by Justice

Take +1 to Passion (max +3)

### I Don't Hate You

When you **guide and comfort** someone in an awkward, understated, or idiosyncratic fashion, roll with Passion instead of Harmony if you mark Insecure or Insecure is already marked.

## Moment of Balance

- Unlocked: :material-check-circle: :material-check-circle:{ .unchecked }
- Used: :material-check-circle:{ .unchecked } :material-check-circle:{ .unchecked }

You've held true to a core of conviction even while getting your hands dirty to do what you deemed necessary. But balance means appreciating that other people are just as complex as you are, not merely obstacles or pawns. Tell the GM how you solve an intractable problem or calm a terrible conflict by relating to dangerous people on a human level.

| Name         | Approach          | Level        | Text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pinpoint Aim | Defend & Maneuver |  :material-check-circle: :material-check-circle: :material-check-circle: | Take the time you need to line up a perfect shot; become Prepared. In the next exchange, if you advance and attack, roll with Focus or Passion, your choice. If you use Strike, you do not have to mark fatigue to choose what you inflict. |
| Fire Stream | Defend & Maneuver |  :material-check-circle: :material-check-circle:{ .unchecked } :material-check-circle:{ .unchecked } | Pour fire upon a target. Mark 1-fatigue to inflict Impaired on them. Mark 3-fatigue to inflict Doomed and Impaired. Mark 5-fatigue to inflict Trapped, Doomed, and Impaired. |

## Character creation notes

- born in fire nation, but grew up in Torch Town, a fire nation colony (founded 5-10 years before moving) on ~unoccupied land (currently at least, all Fire Nation) on Earth Kingdom coast (well-defended, probably an ancient city). whole city was an extended army base
- father Kaya in military leadership, Commander
- trained her whole life for army with twin brother, Ganzaya, who's now a Corporal
- had a break with family, she's angry with them, they're worried about her
- was trained in military basics (work as unit), playing around with growing flames, has always used fire-bending as fun (encouraged in family, not in school) so doesn't quite realize how others see it, is looking for self-expression and creativity in fire (not destruction), playing around with "reverse shadow puppets"
- during pre-deployment camping trip, came across an Earth Kingdom family in a clearing just having fun together and saw them removed by fire nation soldiers. soldiers also destroyed a printing press, which was producing pamphlets about preserving culture, etc (not overtly political)
- had an "everything I've ever learned is wrong" moment, but brother didn't listen ("this is what we've trained for our whole lives") and deploys, while Zo runs away
- learned pragmatism from her father
- tattoo is a symbol of her burden and family, and the things she's believed that aren't true
    - wears military boots
    - has a fortune teller (made from paper) with Moroccan-style tea painting on it, shows the beauty that can be made with fire
- she's desperate for something right to believe in and a partner, bereft, grieving the sense of knowing what's right/true
- Fire Nation military is basically all Navy
- Zo not in touch with family right now
- how disguised is she? hair is short and shaggy (cut off ponytail), wearing clothes she stole, carries self sneakily
- at beginning of play, others don't know she's a firebender
