# Avatar Legends

From campaign creation worksheet:

- Hundred year war era, ~20 years into it
    - unclear if air nomad genocide has happened, but even if so, people don't really know about it
- light canon, use what we know, but don't feel too constrained
- broad scope, want to see the world
- themes / etc people want to hit:
    - cabbage merchant
    - Fire Nation colonies
    - Spirit World
    - New settings
    - White Lotus
- **Focus**: protect culture of people invaded by Fire Nation

Inciting incident:

- in Jiangbu, a small port in the Western Earth Kingdom. not currently
  under control of Fire Nation, but they're ... putting out probes
- Act 1: befriended ally who gave us access to valuable item
    - Yating (air nomad who left, renounced vows, more violent, older woman) runs restaurant (serves best bao in town, hand-drawn menu on the wall), where all the party gathers
    - told them story of Jiangbu's guardian spirit, on mountain (source of river that runs through town) with iron veins (unexploited)
    - grandma's grandma's grandma saw the spirit, and every woman in her family since then has gone on pilgrimages to the site
- Act 2: defended ally from powerful foe
    - toughs (disguised Fire Nationa soldiers and Earth Kingdom mercenaries) roughed her up in kitchen, trying to get info
    - the party intervened and scared them away, Yating is cagey about what they wanted or why (because the party's full of obviously orphaned children)
- Act 3: we were saved from powerful foe by ally, to their own detriment
    - "Uncle" Hanako (knows Zo), sergeant of advance guard scouting area
    - party arrived at restaurant to find it burned down
